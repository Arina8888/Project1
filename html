                <h3>Phishing attacks</h3>
                <h4>Phishing attacks, Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p>Phishing attacks represent a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape, targeting individuals and organizations alike through malicious tactics. Phishing often begins with 
                   malicious emails or messages that appear legitimate, tricking recipients into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials or financial details.Phishers employ social 
                   engineering techniques to manipulate human psychology. They may impersonate trusted entities, creating a false sense of urgency or importance to prompt quick and unsuspecting responses.
                   One of the dangers of phishing is the potential for severe financial implications. Victims may fall prey to scams that lead to unauthorized access to bank accounts 
                   or fraudulent transactions.
                   Phishing attacks can result in data breaches, exposing personal and confidential information. This can lead to identity theft, with attackers using stolen details for malicious purposes.
                   In a business context,  phishing can take the form of Business Email Compromise, where attackers target employees with access to financial or sensitive data, 
                   leading to financial losses for the organization.

                <h3>Operational controls</h3>
                <h4>Operational controls, Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p>
                    Operational controls are a critical component of cybersecurity strategies, focusing on the day-to-day processes and procedures to ensure the security of an organization's 
                    information assets. Operational controls play a vital role in risk management by implementing measures to identify, assess, and mitigate potential security risks within 
                    an organization's operational environment. Implementing robust access control policies is a fundamental operational control.It includes ongoing security awareness training for employees.
                    Educating staff about cybersecurity best practices helps create a human firewall against potential threats. Developing and regularly testing incident response plans are
                    crucial operational controls. Having a well-defined process for handling security incidents minimizes the impact of potential breaches. Operational controls address the timely application 
                    of security patches and updates. Regular patch management is essential to close vulnerabilities and protect systems from known exploits.
